First of all, I will say that I've only eaten from their hot-food island (or whatever you call it) once, because it was so bland, yet so EXPENSIVE, that I never wanted to try anything else they offer. Having said that, I must say that their seafood soups are quite tasty, especially the lobster bisque, but they are also so astronomically priced that I can rarely afford to indulge. The only time when I buy something at Whole Foods is when it's on sale or from their bargain cheese bin (which everyone should check out if they go here... great deals!). Actually, one star is just for the bargain cheese bin. Without that, it would definitely only get two.","date":"2009-03-03 20:58:55"}

I was extremely pleased with the variety of options on the menu, the service, and the quality of food. Our order arrived promptly and everything was warm, fresh and absolutely delicious. The butter chicken and naan were particular favorites. We're looking forward to ordering again soon and trying some of the other dishes.","date":"2014-01-17 01:40:44"}

However, yesterday we stopped for dinner there and I had a Custom Combo comprising a half rack of Chili's \"Original\" ribs and grilled salmon with sides of mashed potatoes and broccoli.  The ribs were tough and poorly prepared, clearly not slow cooked -  and just not very flavorful.  The mashed potatoes were rather gummy - the broccoli and salmon were OK.  Service was good - we had an attentive and friendly waiter but he could not make up for a below average meal.  Not sure we will go back again.","date":"2011-04-22 19:54:08"}

Service was bad and food was mediocre. The main dining room was about half full and that was all they could accommodate because they didn't have the staff. Ended up sitting at the bar. Got the fish tacos and there was very little fish actually in there. Not impressed :( had high hopes","date":"2014-07-13 17:03:00"}

More below.\n\nI wasn't very hungry so I decided just to have the hummus with pita appetizer.  Wow -- big portion!  There was easily enough there for two people and it was delicious.  It tasted like there might be some roasted red peppers added in, but I'm not sure.  \n\nNow... my friend ordered the burger and the waiter told him they don't cook it below medium well. WTF?  Seriously?  I don't even remember the excuse but it was really lame.  He ordered it anyway and then wished he hadn't since it had no pink at all.  The fries were good, but very McDonald's-like.\n\nThe desserts were truly delicious.  My friend had a wonderful float made with Abita root beer and I had the bread pudding, which was so light and fluffy -- really good!   \n\nI'll probably come back and update this review because the desserts can probably overcome the stupid burger policy.","date":"2010-11-23 03:22:26"}

Cafeteria-type vibe, very no frills, with healthy offerings. I got a glass of fresh squeezed juice and the stuffed avocado salad and paid about $15 including tax and a small tip. I'm sure there are more innovative options (menu and flavor wise) for comparable prices nearby. That being said, the food is basic, good, and yes, affordable. The descriptions on yelp were accurate - I had some food left over for another meal.","date":"2015-07-03 19:13:36"}

She fit me in last minute and gave me one of the best deep tissue massages I've ever had. I went in with lower back pain and discomfort and left feeling amazing. She makes it seem easy. She found every sore spot on me and just fixed it all within an hour appointment. She obviously knows her anatomy well. She also has a welcoming and genuine personality.

Tall private booths, with a sports and breakfast food theme, very clean. I got the pancake combo, the eggs were fine, bacon cooked perfectly, hash browns too greasy, but the cakes were super. Light, a little fluffy, and buttery, perfectly prepared. My wife got eggs benedict and said among the price levels places similar to this one, they are the best she has had in Indy. That's saying something because its the only thing she orders for breakfast. Fruit was fresh. Staff was great super friendly and on the ball. Service was quick. The place is really big so we didn't have to wait long to be seated. Prices are what you'd expect.","date":"2017-05-13 14:09:53"}
